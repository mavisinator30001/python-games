# Python Games

## What are these games/what are they going to be?

### These games are random ideas I come up with that I feel like would be fun to program in Python with as few libraries as possible





# Known issues:

### In Ride_the_Bus the win case does not give points to the player
### There is no requirements.txt file with required Python libraries
